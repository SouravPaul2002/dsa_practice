Question: "Delivery Route Check"

Story:
A delivery company logs how the weight in a driver's van changes at each stop:
a positive number means packages were loaded, 
a negative number means packages were dropped off. 
The company wants to know, for the whole day's log of n stops, 
how many different continuous stretches of stops had a net change of exactly zero 
(meaning the same amount was loaded and dropped off across those stops).

Input Format:

Line 1: n
Line 2: n integers, the change at each stop (can be negative, positive, or zero)

Output Format:

One integer, the number of continuous stretches with a net change of exactly zero.

Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
-1000 ≤ value ≤ 1000

Test Cases:

Input:
