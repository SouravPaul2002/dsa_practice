Question: "Munna's Candy Boxes"

Story:
Munna is at a candy shop with n boxes arranged in a row, 
each with a certain number of candies. He wants to pick some boxes 
to maximize his total candies, but there's a rule: 
he can pick at most 2 boxes in a row — meaning he cannot pick 3 consecutive boxes, 
but picking 2 consecutive boxes is allowed.

Find the maximum total candies Munna can collect.

Input Format:

Line 1: n
Line 2: n integers — candies in each box

Output Format:

Maximum total candies.

Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
0 ≤ candies[i] ≤ 10^4
